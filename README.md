# Quiz Game ðŸŽ®

A fun, interactive quiz game where users can select a difficulty level, answer multiple-choice questions, and track their score. This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Bootstrap for responsive design.

## Features

- *Difficulty Levels*: Users can select from three difficulty levels â€” Easy, Medium, and Hard.
- *Score Tracking*: After answering questions, users receive their score.
- *User Experience*: Smooth transitions between the main menu, level selection, and quiz stages.
- *Responsive Design*: Built using Bootstrap to ensure the game is playable across different devices.

## Technologies Used

- *HTML*: Structure of the quiz game.
- *CSS*: Styling and animations for the game interface.
- *JavaScript*: Logic for the quiz game, including handling user inputs, changing questions, and calculating the score.
- *Bootstrap*: For responsive layout and button styles.

## How It Works

1. *Start Screen*: Upon opening the page, users are greeted with a welcome screen and a "Start" button.
2. *Level Selection*: After clicking "Start", users can input their name and choose a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard).
3. *Quiz Questions*: The game dynamically loads questions based on the selected difficulty level. Each question has multiple-choice options.
4. *Score Calculation*: After answering each question, the user's score is updated. Once all questions have been answered, the user is shown their final score.
5. *Return Options*: Users can return to the main menu or select a different level after completing the quiz.

## CSS Styles

- *Responsive Layout*: The game interface is styled using Bootstrap for responsiveness.
- *Animations*: The title of the game has a glowing animation effect, and buttons have hover effects for a better user experience.
